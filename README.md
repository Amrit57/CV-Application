# About
This is my pratice project which I created during the Odin Project. In this project my main focus is to handle props, sharing states between the components, and understanding the core fundamentals of props, states, components, conditional rendering, and updating arrays and objects in React. This project also showcases the ability and understanding of controlled components and  handling a large number of input fields/form-data.

# Technology used in this project
-React
-JSX
-CSS

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
